## Note

1. Sorry for the extremely verbose code in some cases. I have coded it that way so that I understand the steps properly, especially in some cases where complex mathematical steps are involved. But it's no excuse for not writing idiomatic code, I get it.
2. I have not tested the functions inside this library for all possible inputs. Will look to improve the code incrementally.
